# scRNAseq
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis described in an article by Nitta et al, entitled "Fibroblasts as a source of self-antigens for central immune tolerance" (Nature Immunology).
Data of thymic stromal cells were extracted from GSE dataset (GSE103967, Experiment ID: thymus_stroma_WT)(Bornstein et al, Nature 2018, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0346-1), and k-means clustering was performed using the Seurat R Package (v. 2.3.4) after normalization and cell cycle correction.
